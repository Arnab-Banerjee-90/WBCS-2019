					<li>El Ni√±o is a narrow warm current , which ocassionally appears off the coast of Peru in <strong>December</strong> by temporarily replacing the cold Peru current</li>
					<li>Characterized by unusually warm ocean temperatures in the equatorial region of the Pacific Ocean.</li>
					<li>Warming of the tropical pacific waters affect the global pattern of pressure and wind systems including the moonsoon winds in the Indian ocean</li>
					<li>It occurs every 4 to 7 years</li>
					<li>In the El-Nino years differnt regions of the Earth's surface experience drought as well as cyclone and flooding</li>
				</ul>

				<summary><h3>La-Nino</h3></summary>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Female Counterpart</strong> of El-Nino</li>
					<li>Climate pattern that describes the cooling of surface ocean waters along the tropical west coast of South America</li>
					<li>It is a harbinger of heavy moonsoon showers in India</li>
				</ul>

				<summary><h3>ENSO</h3></summary>
				<ul>
					<li>El-Nino southern Oscillation</li>
					<li>Discovered by British climatologist <strong>Gilbert Walker</strong></li>
					<li>Whenever the surface level pressure is high over the Indian ocean, there is low pressure over the Pacific ocean and vice versa, this inter-relation of high and low pressure over the Pacific and the Indian ocean is called <strong>Southern Oscillation</strong></li>
					<li>Affects the climate of much of the tropics and subtropics</li>
				</ul>

				<summary><h3>MONEX</h3></summary>
				<ul>
					<li>The effects of monsoons in different parts of the world on the Earth's atmosphere were studied by MONEX, India's Monsoon Experiment program</li>
				</ul>
			</details>
			<details>
				<summary><h3>Cloud Burst</h3></summary>
				<ul>
					<li>Excessive rainfall over 100mm in 1 hour, In India it occurs in the Western Ghats and the Himalayas</li>
					<li><strong>Wet Day</strong> is referred to as a day with 1mm rainfall in 24 hours</li>
					<li><strong>Rainy Day</strong> is referred to as a day with minimum of 0.25mm rainfall in 24 hours</li>
				</ul>

				<summary><h3>ITCZ</h3></summary>
				<ul>
					<li>The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, is a belt of low pressure which circles the Earth generally near the equator where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres come together</li>
				</ul>

			<details>
				<summary><h3>Western Disturbance</h3></summary>
				<ul>
					<li>A Western Disturbance is an extratropical storm originating in the Mediterranean region that brings sudden winter rain to the northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent</li>
					<li>Western Disturbances are important for the development of the Rabi crop, which includes the locally important staple wheat</li>
